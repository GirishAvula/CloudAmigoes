**Sustainability Benchmarking &amp; Predictive Forecasting******

Our hackathon concept, **'Sustainability Benchmarking & Predictive Forecasting'** features a dynamic dashboard designed to accept PDFs as inputs. These PDFs are seamlessly uploaded to **Google Storage buckets**, streamlining the data acquisition process. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of **Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) 'Vertex AI Search and Conversation' service**, we employ generative AI to process these PDFs. This service not only extracts key insights but also responds to user queries initiated from the dashboard through API interactions, enhancing the efficiency and interactivity of our solution.

****Breif:****
we leverage **Java and Spring Boot** to develop a robust **backend system**. This backend is responsible for handling various functionalities, including the creation of a dynamic dashboard using **React.js** for the **frontend**. The dashboard interface allows users to seamlessly upload PDF documents, facilitated by integration with **Google Storage buckets using App Engine**.

Underlying this architecture, **Maven** is employed for dependency management and project build automation, ensuring smooth development and deployment processes. The backend services utilize **Spring Boot** to expose **RESTful APIs**, such as the PDF Upload API and Data Extraction API, enabling efficient communication between the frontend and backend components.

Furthermore, we integrate **Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Vertex AI Search and Conversation services** into our Spring Boot backend. Through these services, we harness the power of generative AI for data processing and user interaction. The Conversation API handles natural language queries initiated from the React.js dashboard, providing insightful responses generated by the **AI model**.

Additionally, authentication and authorization functionalities are implemented using Spring Security, ensuring secure access to the dashboard and its features.

Overall, our solution encapsulates the synergy between Java, Spring Boot, React.js, App Engine, and Maven to deliver a comprehensive and interactive platform for sustainability benchmarking and predictive forecasting.


****APIs developed to enhance functionality, interaction, and data processing:****  

**PDF Upload API:** An API that allows users to upload PDF documents directly to the dashboard for processing.

**Data Extraction API:** This API extracts relevant data from the uploaded PDF documents, such as sustainability metrics, financial data, or other key indicators.

**Google Storage Integration API:** Enables seamless integration with Google Storage buckets for storing and retrieving PDF documents.

**Vertex AI Search API:** Utilizes Vertex AI Search capabilities to search and retrieve relevant information from the processed PDF documents.

**Conversation API:** Allows users to interact with the dashboard using natural language queries and receives responses generated by the generative AI model.

**Dashboard Visualization API:** Provides visualization features for displaying benchmarking data, predictive forecasts, and other insights extracted from the PDF documents.

**Notification API:** Sends notifications or alerts to users based on specific events or thresholds identified in the data analysis process.

**Authentication and Authorization API:** Manages user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the dashboard and its functionalities.

**Data Export API:** Allows users to export processed data, reports, or insights generated by the dashboard for further analysis or integration with other systems.

**Integration APIs:** Provides integration capabilities with third-party systems or services, enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability.

These APIs work together to create a comprehensive and interactive solution for sustainability benchmarking and predictive forecasting, enhancing user experience and decision-making capabilities.
